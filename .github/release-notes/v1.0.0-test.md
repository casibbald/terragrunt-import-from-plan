## ✨ Terragrunt Import from Plan v1.0.0-test

This release introduces a GitHub Action that automates the import of resources detected in a `terragrunt plan` into the Terraform state.

### 🚀 Features

- 🔍 Parses `terraform show -json` output from `tf.plan`
- 📦 Dynamically identifies resources with `create`, `create+update`, or `replace` actions
- 🔑 Extracts importable IDs from fields like `repository_id`, `name`, `bucket`, and `id`
- 🛠 Optional support for `PROJECT_ID` and `LOCATION` env vars for building GCP-style import IDs
- 📊 Outputs a summary of:
    - Imported resources
    - Already in state
    - Skipped (due to missing ID)

### 🧪 Included Test Suite

Run `./test/entrypoint_test.sh` to validate logic with mocked input — no infrastructure required.

### 📦 Installation

```yaml
- name: Import from plan
  uses: casibbald/terragrunt-import-from-plan@v1
  with:
    working-directory: ./your/module/path
```

Set `PROJECT_ID` and `LOCATION` as environment variables if you're importing GCP-style resources:

```yaml
env:
  PROJECT_ID: your-project-id
  LOCATION: your-location
```
