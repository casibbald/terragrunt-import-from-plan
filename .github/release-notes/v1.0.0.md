## ✨ Terragrunt Import from Plan v1.0.0

This release introduces a GitHub Action that automates the import of resources detected in a `terragrunt plan` into the Terraform state.

### 🤔 Why Use This Action?

When running `terragrunt plan`, you may have resources marked for creation but not yet in the Terraform state. This action
helps you automatically import those resources, ensuring your state file is up-to-date without manual intervention. This
is particularly useful for CI/CD pipelines where you want to ensure all resources are managed correctly without having
to run `terraform import` commands manually.It is beneficial in Corporate settings where environments use restrictive
GCP, AWS, or Azure IAM, requiring complex Service account impersonation. Often, direct access to import resources is not
always possible in the local environment, or is tedious to set up, or there are security restrictions from having local
access to these environments, especially in Production settings. This resource ensures your Terraform state remains
consistent with the infrastructure, reducing the risk of drift middle of deployments.


### 🚀 Features

- 🔍 Parses `terraform show -json` output from `tf.plan`
- 📦 Dynamically identifies resources with `create`, `create+update`, or `replace` actions
- 🔑 Extracts importable IDs from fields like `repository_id`, `name`, `bucket`, `id`, `arn`, or full Azure resource IDs
- 🛠 Supports optional cloud-specific ID formatting:
  - **GCP**: prefix `projects/$PROJECT_ID/locations/$LOCATION/repositories/...`
  - **AWS**: uses raw `arn:` strings when detected (e.g., `arn:aws:iam::...:role/...`)
  - **Azure**: uses full `/subscriptions/...` IDs directly (e.g., `/subscriptions/.../resourceGroups/...`)
- 📊 Outputs a summary of:
  - Imported resources
  - Already in state
  - Skipped (due to missing ID)

### 🧪 Included Test Suite

Run `./test/entrypoint_test.sh` to validate logic with mocked input — no infrastructure required.

## 🛠 Usage

```yaml
jobs:
  import-plan:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Set up Terragrunt
        uses: metro-digital/cf-github-actions/terragrunt-setup@v1

      - name: Terragrunt Plan
        run: terragrunt plan -out=tf.plan
        working-directory: ${{ github.workspace }}/${{ matrix.environment }}/some-module

      - name: Import resources from plan
        uses: casibbald/terragrunt-import-from-plan@v1
        with:
          working-directory: ${{ github.workspace }}/${{ matrix.environment }}/some-module
```

Optionally set `PROJECT_ID` and `LOCATION` as environment variables for GCP-style imports:

#### For GCP:
```yaml
env:
  PROJECT_ID: your-project-id
  LOCATION: your-location
```

#### For AWS or Azure:
If your resources use `arn:` or `/subscriptions/...`, no additional variables are needed — the action detects and imports using them directly.
