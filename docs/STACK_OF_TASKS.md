### 📘 Educational Notes

- Use `if let Some(...)` instead of `match` when you only need to handle the `Some` case and optionally an `else`. It's cleaner and avoids extra nesting. For example:

```rust
// Preferred when handling one case:
if let Some(ref id) = inferred_id {
// use id
} else {
// handle absence
}

// More verbose equivalent:
match inferred_id {
Some(ref id) => { /* use id */ },
None => { /* handle absence */ },
}
```

This kind of pattern improves readability and aligns with idiomatic Rust.

More educational guidance will be added inline to future task breakdowns and code blocks where relevant.
