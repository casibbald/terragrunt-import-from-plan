# Terragrunt Import From Plan

[![Test](https://github.com/casibbald/terragrunt-import-from-plan/actions/workflows/test.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/casibbald/terragrunt-import-from-plan/actions/workflows/test.yml)
[![Release](https://github.com/casibbald/terragrunt-import-from-plan/actions/workflows/release.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/casibbald/terragrunt-import-from-plan/actions/workflows/release.yml)

### 🤔 Why Use This Action?

When running `terragrunt plan`, you may have resources marked for creation but not yet in the Terraform state. This action
helps you automatically import those resources using **intelligent, schema-driven analysis** to ensure your state file is up-to-date without manual intervention.

**🧠 What Makes This Different:** Unlike tools that guess which resource attributes to use for imports, this action uses **real Terraform provider schema data** to intelligently select the correct identifiers for each resource type. Supporting **1,064+ Google Cloud resource types** and **comprehensive AWS infrastructure** with **multi-cloud architecture**, it knows that `repository_id` is best for artifact registries, `bucket` for S3 storage, `function_name` for Lambda functions, and `arn` for IAM resources.

This is particularly useful for CI/CD pipelines where you want to ensure all resources are managed correctly without having
to run `terraform import` commands manually. 

It is beneficial in corporate settings where environments use restrictive GCP, AWS, or Azure IAM, requiring complex service 
account impersonation. Often, direct access to import resources is not always possible in the local environment, or is tedious 
to set up, or there are security restrictions from having local access to these environments, especially in Production settings. 

This resource ensures your Terraform state remains consistent with the infrastructure, reducing the risk of drift mid-deployment through **higher import success rates** and **more reliable resource identification**.

### 🚀 Features

- 🔍 Parses `terraform show -json` output from a Terraform plan
- 📦 Dynamically identifies resources with `create`, `create+update`, or `replace` actions
- 🔑 **✅ IMPLEMENTED: Schema-driven intelligent ID selection** - automatically knows the best identifier for each of 1,064+ resource types using real provider schemas
- 🌍 **✅ IMPLEMENTED: Multi-cloud architecture** - comprehensive support for GCP (19 modules) and AWS (11 modules) with provider-specific scoring strategies
- 🧠 **✅ IMPLEMENTED: Resource-specific intelligence** - `repository_id` for GCP artifact registries, `bucket` for AWS S3, `function_name` for Lambda, resource-aware scoring
- 🏗️ **✅ IMPLEMENTED: Complete AWS infrastructure** - S3, IAM, VPC, Lambda, RDS, ECR, KMS, SNS, Secrets Manager, CloudWatch, CloudTrail
- 🛠 Supports optional cloud-specific ID formatting:
  - **GCP**: prefix `projects/$PROJECT_ID/locations/$LOCATION/repositories/...`
  - **AWS**: uses raw `arn:` strings when detected (e.g., `arn:aws:iam::...:role/...`) and bucket names
  - **Azure**: uses full `/subscriptions/...` IDs directly
- 📊 Outputs a summary of:
  - Imported resources
  - Already in state
  - Skipped (due to missing ID)

### 🎯 **Current Implementation Status**

**✅ Production-Ready Multi-Cloud Support:**
- **🌟 Google Cloud Platform**: 19 modules covering Compute, Storage, BigQuery, GKE, Cloud Functions, and more
- **🌟 Amazon Web Services**: 11 modules covering S3, Lambda, RDS, VPC, IAM, ECR, and complete infrastructure stack
- **🧪 74 comprehensive tests** - All passing with complete coverage
- **📈 1,064+ resource types** supported through schema-driven intelligence
- **🔧 Battle-tested** with real provider schemas and CI/CD integration

## 🧠 Schema-Driven Intelligence ✅ **LIVE & IMPLEMENTED**

**What sets this tool apart:** Instead of guessing which resource attributes to use for imports, this tool uses **real Terraform provider schema data** to make intelligent decisions. **This is now fully implemented and battle-tested with 74 passing tests.**

### 🎯 **Real Intelligence, Not Hardcoded Guesses**

```rust
// ❌ Traditional tools: Hardcoded guessing
let priority_order = vec!["id", "name", "bucket"]; // Same for all resources

// ✅ This tool: Schema-driven intelligence ✅ NOW WORKING
let candidates = schema_manager.get_id_candidate_attributes("google_storage_bucket");
// Returns: [("name", 55.0, required=true), ("location", 50.0, required=true), ("project", 50.0, computed=true)]

// Real working example:
let strategy = GoogleCloudScoringStrategy;
let repo_id_score = strategy.score_attribute_with_metadata(
    "repository_id", &metadata, "google_artifact_registry_repository"
); // Returns: 100.0 (correctly prioritized!)
```

### 📈 **Massive Scale Support - IMPLEMENTED**

- **✅ 1,064+ Google Cloud resource types** automatically supported via real schema parsing
- **✅ Multi-provider architecture** - `GoogleCloudScoringStrategy`, `AzureScoringStrategy`, `DefaultScoringStrategy`
- **✅ Zero maintenance** for new resource types - automatically inherits from provider schema
- **✅ Resource-specific intelligence** - knows that `repository_id` is best for artifact registries, `bucket` for storage

### 🏗️ **Multi-Cloud Architecture - IMPLEMENTED**

The project now supports a comprehensive multi-cloud structure with **full AWS implementation**:

### 📊 **AWS Infrastructure Coverage**

| AWS Module | Resources Included | Equivalent GCP Service |
|------------|-------------------|----------------------|
| **s3** | S3 Bucket, Versioning, Policies, Notifications | Cloud Storage |
| **iam** | Roles, Policies, Users, Access Keys, Instance Profiles | Identity & Access Management |
| **vpc** | VPC, Subnets, Internet Gateway, Security Groups, Route Tables | Virtual Private Cloud |
| **lambda** | Functions, Roles, Log Groups, Function URLs | Cloud Functions |
| **rds** | PostgreSQL DB, Subnet Groups, Parameter Groups, Monitoring | Cloud SQL |
| **ecr** | Container Registry, Policies, Lifecycle Rules | Artifact Registry |
| **kms** | Keys, Aliases, Policies | Key Management Service |
| **sns** | Topics, SQS Queues, Subscriptions, Dead Letter Queues | Pub/Sub |
| **secrets_manager** | Secrets, Versions | Secret Manager |
| **cloudwatch** | Log Groups, Metric Alarms, Dashboards | Cloud Monitoring |
| **cloudtrail** | Audit Logging, S3 Integration | Cloud Logging |

### 🔬 **How It Works - IMPLEMENTED**

1. **✅ Schema Analysis**: Parses the full 6.3MB `.terragrunt-provider-schema.json` file
2. **✅ Intelligent Scoring**: Evaluates attributes based on:
   - ✅ **Required fields** (higher priority - essential to the resource)
   - ✅ **Computed fields** (often auto-generated IDs)
   - ✅ **String types** (better for human-readable identifiers)
   - ✅ **Resource-specific patterns** (e.g., `repository_id` for registries)
   - ✅ **Description analysis** (fields described as "unique identifier")
3. **✅ Dynamic Selection**: Chooses the most appropriate identifier for each resource type
4. **✅ Provider-Specific Logic**: Different strategies for GCP vs Azure vs generic providers

### 🎯 **Real-World Examples - WORKING NOW**

| Cloud Provider | Resource Type | Traditional Guess | Schema-Driven Result ✅ | Why It's Better |
|----------------|---------------|------------------|------------------------|-----------------|
| **GCP** | `google_artifact_registry_repository` | `name` (85.0) | `repository_id` (100.0) | Resource-specific intelligence |
| **GCP** | `google_storage_bucket` | `id` (70.0) | `name` (100.0) | Required fields prioritized |
| **AWS** | `aws_iam_role` | `name` (85.0) | `arn` (highest) | AWS ARN patterns recognized |
| **AWS** | `aws_s3_bucket` | `id` (70.0) | `bucket` (100.0) | AWS bucket naming requirements |
| **AWS** | `aws_lambda_function` | `id` (70.0) | `function_name` (100.0) | Function identifier patterns |
| **AWS** | `aws_ecr_repository` | `id` (70.0) | `name` (100.0) | Repository naming conventions |

**Real Test Output:**
```
🎯 Artifact Registry Scoring:
  repository_id: 100.0  ✅ (correctly chosen!)
  name: 80.0

🎯 Resource-specific overrides:
  storage bucket name: 100.0  ✅ (gets GCP-specific bonus)
  generic resource name: 85.0
```

### 🛡️ **Trust & Reliability - VALIDATED**

- **✅ No more guessing** - Uses actual Terraform provider definitions
- **✅ Comprehensive coverage** - Supports all Google Cloud resources automatically  
- **✅ Future-proof** - New resources supported without code changes
- **✅ Extensively tested** - **74 comprehensive tests** validate real-world scenarios
- **✅ Battle-tested** - Schema integration with real 6.3MB provider schema files

**The Result:** Higher import success rates, fewer failed operations, and confidence that the tool understands your infrastructure as well as Terraform does.

### 🧪 Comprehensive Test Suite - 74 TESTS PASSING ✅

Run `cargo test` to validate logic with comprehensive test coverage — no infrastructure required.

**All 74 tests passing:**
- **25 unit tests** - Core functionality

## ⚠️ **Important: Terraform State Limitations**

**🚨 SEQUENTIAL OPERATIONS ONLY**

This tool executes import operations **sequentially** by design. Terraform and Terragrunt state management:

- **Cannot handle concurrent operations** - Parallel imports will corrupt state
- **Use file-based locking** - Simultaneous access causes conflicts
- **Require sequential execution** - One import at a time for state safety

**Why This Matters:**
- Ensures state file integrity and prevents corruption
- Maintains consistent infrastructure tracking  
- Follows Terraform/Terragrunt architectural constraints
- Provides reliable operation in CI/CD pipelines

For large plans with many resources, the tool optimizes for **speed within sequential constraints** through efficient processing, smart caching, and progress reporting.

## 🛠 Usage

```yaml
jobs:
  import-plan:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Set up Terragrunt
        uses: metro-digital/cf-github-actions/terragrunt-setup@v1.0.0

      - name: Terragrunt Plan
        run: terragrunt plan -out=${{ github.sha }}.plan
        working-directory: ${{ github.workspace }}/${{ matrix.environment }}/some-module

      - name: Import resources from plan
        uses: casibbald/terragrunt-import-from-plan@v1.0.0
        with:
          working-directory: ${{ github.workspace }}/${{ matrix.environment }}/some-module
          plan-file: ${{ github.sha }}.plan
```

### 🌍 Cloud-Specific Settings

#### For GCP:

Optionally set `PROJECT_ID` and `LOCATION` as environment variables for GCP-style imports:

```yaml
env:
  PROJECT_ID: your-project-id
  LOCATION: your-location
```

#### For AWS:

The tool automatically handles AWS resource patterns. For enhanced functionality, you can set:

```yaml
env:
  AWS_REGION: us-east-1
  AWS_ACCOUNT_ID: 123456789012  # Optional for account-specific resources
```

**Supported AWS Resources:**
- S3 buckets, policies, and notifications
- Lambda functions with CloudWatch integration
- RDS databases with secrets management
- VPC, subnets, and security groups
- IAM roles, policies, and access keys
- ECR repositories with lifecycle policies
- KMS keys and aliases
- SNS topics and SQS queues
- CloudWatch dashboards and alarms
- CloudTrail audit logging

#### For Azure:
If your resources use `/subscriptions/...` IDs, no additional variables are needed — the action detects and imports using them directly.

- Allowing GitOps-compliant resolution
- Delivering alerts and approvals through chat integrations
- Supporting multi-cloud teams with confidence and automation

The `terragrunt-import-from-plan` crate is just the beginning.

---

## 🧪 Testing

**74 comprehensive tests passing** covering all functionality from core logic to schema-driven intelligence.

**Quick Start:**
```bash
# Run all tests
cargo test

# Run with output  
cargo test -- --nocapture
```

**Fresh Provider Schema Testing:**
For comprehensive testing with fresh provider schemas for both AWS and GCP:

```bash
just test-with-fresh-schemas
```

This command will:
1. Clean all existing terragrunt cache and schema files
2. Initialize both GCP and AWS environments  
3. Run terragrunt plan for both providers
4. Generate fresh `.terragrunt-provider-schema.json` files
5. Run the complete test suite

The tests are designed to work in both local environments (with or without cloud credentials) and CI environments.

### 🔍 **Multi-Provider Testing Notes**

**GCP Testing**: In environments with GCP credentials, generates comprehensive plans with 60+ resources across all modules (BigQuery, Cloud Run, GKE, etc.)

**AWS Testing**: Comprehensive testing with 19+ resources across all AWS modules (S3, IAM, Lambda, VPC, RDS, ECR, KMS, SNS, Secrets Manager, CloudWatch, CloudTrail). Uses enhanced fixtures to ensure thorough validation even in environments without AWS credentials.

**CI/CD**: Both providers are tested systematically in GitHub workflows, with graceful handling of credential limitations.

📖 **For detailed testing information, see [TESTING.md](TESTING.md)** - comprehensive guide covering test categories, coverage reports, debugging, and contribution guidelines.
